# To mock or not to mock?

<!--
Hello everyone, I‚Äôm Giorgos. I work as a software engineer, and whenever I sit down to write new tests, I run into the same questions:

Should I mock here or not? And if I do, which kind of test double is the right fit?

To answer that, let‚Äôs start at the beginning: what exactly is a test double?
-->

---

# What is a test double?
A test double is to code what a stunt double is to an actor.


<img border="rounded" src="/test_double_bears.png" alt="" class="w-full h-[90%] object-contain"/>

<!--
Just like actors don‚Äôt perform every dangerous scene themselves and stunt doubles step in for them.

Okay maybe not Tom Cruise.

In the same way, we use test doubles in place of real objects. They take the risks for us ‚Äî making our tests faster, safer, and more predictable.

Without them, our tests get tied to real services and environments, and that‚Äôs when things become slow and flaky.

<!--
Having said that, let's take a look at the different types of test doubles.

We have...

All of them can replace objects in our code, but each one serves a different purpose.

And in fact they can be used together as well.
-->

---

# What is a mock?

A type of test double that we can use to replace real objects in our code.

It replaces the orginal object with that we can control the behavior of, and allows us to track the interactions with the mocked object. 

When using the `unittest` framework we can use either `Mock` or `MagicMock` classes to create a mock object.

```python [example_mock.py]
import unittest.mock as mock

mock_object = mock.Mock()

mock_object.some_method()  # calling some random method returns another mock object

mock_object.some_method.assert_called_once() # we can track interactions with the mock object

```

<!--
A mock is a type of test_double that stand in place for real objects in our code.

It replaces the original object with one that we can control the behavior of, and allows us to track the interactions with the mocked object.

In Python's built-in test framework there are two foundational classes that create mocks, 
Mocks & MagicMocks.
-->

# Difference between `Mock` and `MagicMock`?

The main difference is that `MagicMock` has "magic methods" pre-defined and ready to use, while `Mock` does not.

This means that if you need to mock an object that uses magic methods, such as a context manager or a container, you should use `MagicMock`.

<div class="twocol">

```python [example_magic_mock.py]
import unittest.mock as mock

mock_object = mock.MagicMock()

# MagicMock has __enter__ & __exit__ magic methods
with mock_object as m:
    pass

# track interactions with the mock object
mock_object.__enter__.assert_called_once()
```

```python [example_mock_fail.py]
import unittest.mock as mock

mock_object = mock.Mock()

# Mock does not have __enter__ & __exit__ magic methods
with mock_object as m:
    pass
```
</div>

---

# Pure mocks

<br/>

## Pros
Pure mocks, help us track and validate the order of calls and the exact arguments with which the mocked objects
are being invoked, we set fixtures and return values as a means to aid the flow of execution of our unit under test

## Cons
and our goal is to verify the interactions of our unit under test with the mocked code, we do not actually care beyond this
scope, we assume that the mocked code given valid arguments will produce valid results. In other terms we test the behavior
of our code.
